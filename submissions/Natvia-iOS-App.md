## Project Title

Tthing - Consumables Replacement Reminder

## Project Description    
Tthing is a smart iOS application that helps users track and manage the replacement cycles of everyday consumables. Many items like toothbrushes, towels, and razor blades have recommended replacement periods for hygiene and health reasons, but they're easy to forget.

The app allows users to register products by selecting categories, automatically suggests appropriate replacement intervals, and sends timely push notifications when it's time to replace items. Users can track multiple products, view their status at a glance, and receive reminders to maintain healthier living habits.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration came from a simple yet important observation: we all use consumable products daily that need periodic replacement for health and hygiene reasons, but we often forget when we started using them or when they should be replaced.

Items like toothbrushes should be replaced every 3 months, towels every 6 months, and razor blades regularly - but without a tracking system, we tend to use them longer than recommended. This not only affects hygiene but can also impact our health. I wanted to create a solution that makes it effortless to track these products and never miss a replacement date, promoting healthier daily habits.
